Is the people my consciousness witnesses real people or..., or alternative versions of myself? What is this? What is our past? What is our present? And what will be our future? What is our purpose in this world? How will it end? Or it may never end? People are scared of death but I believe that I'll never die and my consciousness will continue to live forever. How did we come this way? Was there an alternative way of human history and evolution? How can we be smarter or dumber? A lot of questions I know, let's discuss them in the comments.
